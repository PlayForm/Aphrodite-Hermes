# very same `<name>.<pid>.0` path the first load already mapped, and on
# Windows overwriting a mapped DLL fails with PermissionError [Errno 13].

# sys.modules makes it survive re-exec: later copies of the shim find the
# holder, hit the mtime early-return in `_load_dylib`, and reuse the CDLL
# handle that is already mapped instead of copying (and leaking) a second
