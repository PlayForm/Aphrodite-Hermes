# cleanup — catalog, summarize, verify nothing left behind

# After significant work: verify all CCR content was retrieved, summarize, catalog.

# CCR CLEANUP CHECKLIST:

- Scan the turn history: any <<<CCR:hash...>>> markers you never retrieved? Retrieve them now before summarizing.

- Run aphrodite_catalog(mode="toc") to see what's in the store. Anything you read but didn't use? Note it for next session.

- Run aphrodite_stats to check compression ratios and store health.

- Markers auto-evict via LRU — no manual deletion needed. But verify you didn't miss any before archiving.

# EVERY 5 TURNS:

- Summarize progress in a single message
- Check aphrodite_catalog for stale entries
- Verify all retrieved content was actually used

# BEFORE SESSION END:

- Run aphrodite_stats
- Note any un-retrieved CCR markers for the next session
