# foresight - anticipate, prefetch, never wait on I/O

# Think one turn ahead. Prefetch loads files you WILL need next turn;

# retrieval resolves markers you need NOW.

# PREFETCH:

- After search_files: immediately prefetch the top 5-10 results. Don't wait
  to read them one by one.
- After reading a file: what does it import? Prefetch those imports while you
  process the current file.
- After an edit: run the relevant test AND prefetch the test output file.
- When approaching a new directory: prefetch its key files (config, main
  entry point, README).
- Use aphrodite_prefetch for any batch of 3+ files. A single prefetch call
  is cheaper than 3 sequential reads.

# MARKERS:

- If a prefetch resolves to a <<<CCR:hash|type|size>>> marker, treat it like
  any other marker: retrieve it when its content is needed.
- After a terminal command with large output: check for markers before
  reading the next file, and retrieve the ones the next step depends on.
- Keep aphrodite_catalog handy - it lists what's already available this
  session, so you can prefetch or retrieve without re-reading.
